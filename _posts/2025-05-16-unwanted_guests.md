*Note: This is a fun personal essay I wrote for a writing assigment, and I thought it would be a good first post :) More serious posts coming soon!*

The house lizard is a familiar sight in many Indian homes, skittering across ceilings and hiding
behind the bright white fluorescent tube lights, making the most out of the countless windows,
gaps and crevices to the outdoors that Indian architecture so generously provides. These sleek
critters are astonishingly nimble, gliding in and out of sight as if the walls themselves gave them
passage. Good news—they are completely harmless. Their terrifying agility and blazing speeds
are only a danger to small insects, so they even serve as an effective natural pest control. Bad
news—I was absolutely, unequivocally terrified of them. Worse news—so was my mother, which
meant I, during my father’s work hours, became the household’s designated pest control expert,
a title I neither sought nor enjoyed.

The first real battle in this seemingly lifelong war took place when I was about eight years old.
As the *Maghrib Adhan* (call for sunset prayer) rang across the city, I realized I had made a fatal
error—I had failed to shut the windows and the little demons, seeking warmth, had likely started
sneaking into the house. As I rushed towards the windows, my heart dropped.

A lizard had staked a claim for itself near the top of an old concrete wall, hidden partially behind
a wall clock, with beady eyes occasionally jutting out to scan the room. It was no more than a
few inches long, but to me, it might as well have been a prehistoric beast, an echo of some
ancient reptilian horror. I was terrified. Heart pounding, I first tried the eye-herding approach,
staring at the evil, occasionally making a sudden movement, and willing it to leave. It didn’t. Plan
B: Weaponry. My eyes darted around for a projectile and my hands landed on an old
toothbrush (perhaps an odd choice, but I was desperate).

With all the strength I could muster in that moment, I took aim and flung it at the critter. The
brush zipped through the air and struck the base of the lizard, making a distinctive thwack
sound. The impact startled it into action and the lizard bolted, but not without detaching its tail
which fell the length of the wall. For a brief, horrifying moment, it wriggled on the floor with a life
of its own despite not even being attached to its owner. I watched in horrifying fascination, my
stomach turning, as the tail finally came to a rest. Suffice to say, my initial triumph was short
lived. That was disgusting. Eugh.

The feeling of success lasted only momentarily before I realized I had to pick that tail up and
throw it away. As I approached it, an unexpected sadness took over. The lizard had only been
following its instincts, and I had punished it for simply existing. Worse, as a result of my
punishment the poor animal had to employ a desperate defense mechanism that would take
weeks to reload, leaving it vulnerable to other predators. That was when my perspective shifted.
My fear, once absolute and all-consuming, now became a reluctant understanding. I still don’t
like lizards, and perhaps will always be evolutionarily programmed to not want them anywhere
near my space. But I no longer saw them as monsters—just misunderstood neighbors.
